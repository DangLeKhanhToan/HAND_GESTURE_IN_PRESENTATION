# HAND_GESTURE_IN_PRESENTATION
I'm using mediapipe to recognize my hand gesture, applying it to send control signals for the presentation that
+ Gesture 1: Move forward
+ Gesture 2: Move backward
+ Gesture 3: Pointer
+ Gesture 4: Drawing
+ Gesture 5: Erase

I also include a line that call control line, in case that we want to have some
body language, we can put our hand under the line to not being misunderstanding 
with the control signals - the hand gesture

- Need improvement:
  + I'm only use one hand on this excercises
  + The drawing was not calculate clearly so it may a little to fast
  to control easily
  + My hand gesture may a little bit to hard to get right in real time
  ( just only some of them, like Erase Gesture)
